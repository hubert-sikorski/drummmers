# Drummmers App - [drummmers.surge.sh](http://drummmers.surge.sh)

This app enables the user to search for their favorite track or artist and save
them as a new playlist to Spotify. Before choosing the track you can preview it
and then make a decision if it's worthy or not. After doing so you add it to the
new list and do exactly the same thing with other tracks until you are satisfied
with the new list. The final step is to name the list and save it as a new playlist
straight to your Spotify account!
